\section{Introduction}
Often times, a project becomes big enough that it is infeasible for it to be worked on by a simgle Agile Team. Examples of such can be entire product suites or multi-departmental projects. Under these circumstances, it becomes more useful to divide the project amongst multiple agile teams. By the nature of the agile workflow, this can become chaotic and counter-productive unless managed properly. To ensure efficient and functional multi-team agile development process, teams should prioritize communication, clear objective definitions, cross-functional teams, and a decentralized but cohesive architecture.

\section{Multi-Team dynamics}
\subsection{Proper Communication in Agile}
Agile, normally being a chaotic and hasty managment process is difficult to coordinate with other agile processes. It is for the reason it is important to prioritize communication and documentation as this allows other teams to stay up to date and on a similar track. Without an emphasis on communication and documentation, by the nature of agile, projects tend to diverge.

Team communication in agile normally manifests itself in the form of the daily standup meeting. to facilitate cross-team communication, these standup meetings should be adjusted to contain all the teams. This promotes dicusssions on topics pertinent to more than 1 team. It is also important to make sure the the scrum masters are communicating constantly as communication desynchronization give way to project desynchronization. The agile alliance also defines a tactis known as "The Scrum of Scrums" where the Scrum masters from each team may go speak on the team's behalf. This allows scrum masters to stay up to date with the progress and work done by other teams.

\subsection{Objective Definition}
Another factor to be mindful of when facilitating work between multiple agile teams is to mindful that the goal of the project is clearly defined. This can also manifest in the form of making sure product owner meetings are conducted  with members from every team. Ensuring that every team has a clearly defined objective helps each team to be working towards a common goal. Even slight deviation in the project goal or suggestions from the sponsor could cause teams to create incompatible progress on the project.

\subsection{Cross-functional Teams}
It is important to make sure members of teams aren't specialized to the work they are doing. Agile teams should be multi-disciplinary and multi-functional to encourage communication and allow for diversity in work. Agile as a process encourages diversity in teams to allow for a smooth uniform workflow and encouraging specialists goes against this workflow. This becomes especially destructive to commmunication between teams as specialization leads to close-mindedness.

\subsection{Tools for Agile Development}
Tool are incredibly important in an agile project and become essential in a multi-team settings. The more people in an agile project, the more difficult it becomes to keep everything orgnized, up to date, and correct between several teams. Various tools have been developed to assist not just individual teams, but assist teams in working together to track progress, fascilitate communication and present documentation.

\subsubsection{Tracking Progress}
Computerized Agile tools have been aroudn since the advent of Agile, or computers, whichever came first. Some are better than others but when it comes to multi-team agile workflows, to be better, they need to accomodate and support multiple teams. One particularly amazing tool is called Jira which can be used with plugins to be useful for large teams to organize progress on a project

\subsubsection{Communication}
Communication is always important and becomes ever-moreso in circumstances where collaborating agile teams may not be in the same location. In this circumstance it becomes essential to have more than one communication tool as they would each serve a separate purpose. For day-to-day chatting and discussions, slack comes highly recommended by hundreds of thousands. For video and voice chatting services many options exist such Google Hangouts, Cisco's WebEx, LogMeIn's GoToMeeting, and Microsoft's Skype for business, each with their own pros and cons and each serving a similar purpose.

\subsubsection{Documentation}
Just as with communication, documenting progress or project information becomes increasingly necessary when the teams are distributed. Microsoft has a slough of tools designed expressly for this purpose such as OneDrive for Business, Sharepoint, Exchange, and many others. Each of these services allow for document storage and presentation. OneDrive even has initial workings to allow for collaborative document editing via it's Word, Excel, and PowerPoint Online tools. Much smaller and more open projects typically use Google Drive to do document storage and collaborstive editing as it easy to learn, slim, and, more importantly, free.

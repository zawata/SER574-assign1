\section{Introduction}
Often times, a project becomes big enough that it is infeasible for it to be worked on by a simple Agile Team. Examples of such can be entire product suites or multi-departmental projects. Under these circumstances, it becomes more useful to divide the project amongst multiple agile teams. By the nature of the agile workflow, this can become chaotic and counter-productive unless managed properly. To ensure efficient and functional multi-team agile development process, teams should prioritize communication, clear objective definitions, cross-functional teams, and a decentralized but cohesive architecture.

\section{Multi-Team dynamics}
\subsection{Proper Communication in Agile}
Agile, normally being a chaotic and hasty management process is difficult to coordinate with other agile processes. It is for the reason it is important to prioritize communication and documentation as this allows other teams to stay up to date and on a similar track. Without an emphasis on communication and documentation, by the nature of agile, projects tend to diverge.

Team communication in agile normally manifests itself in the form of the daily stand-up meeting. to facilitate cross-team communication, these stand-up meetings should be adjusted to contain all the teams. This promotes discussions on topics pertinent to more than 1 team. It is also important to make sure the the scrum masters are communicating constantly as communication desynchronization give way to project desynchronization. The agile alliance also defines a tactics known as "The Scrum of Scrums" where the Scrum masters from each team may go speak on the team's behalf. This allows scrum masters to stay up to date with the progress and work done by other teams.

\subsection{Objective Definition}
Another factor to be mindful of when facilitating work between multiple agile teams is to mindful that the goal of the project is clearly defined. This can also manifest in the form of making sure product owner meetings are conducted  with members from every team. Ensuring that every team has a clearly defined objective helps each team to be working towards a common goal. Even slight deviation in the project goal or suggestions from the sponsor could cause teams to create incompatible progress on the project.

\subsection{Cross-functional Teams}
It is important to make sure members of teams aren't specialized to the work they are doing. Agile teams should be multi-disciplinary and multi-functional to encourage communication and allow for diversity in work. Agile as a process encourages diversity in teams to allow for a smooth uniform workflow and encouraging specialists goes against this workflow. This becomes especially destructive to communication between teams as specialization leads to close-mindedness.

\section{Design and Architecture}
The Agile manifesto emphasizes face to face communication as the most effective way of conveying information and collaboration between Agile teams. Effective collaboration is the key to a successful software development and product delivery for any Agile team. However, in the real scenario, this is constantly challenged due to the fact that teams are large and often distributed in the organizations, forcing communications to take place in different directions.
\par
Agile teams should be self-organizing to be able to produce the best architectures, requirements, and designs. To some extent, it is the responsibility of the larger organization to enable the collaborative environment for its teams for emergent architecture designs while providing guides and architectural standards for the entire organization system that is beyond their scale. A simple, easily implementable, collaborative architecture is enables teams to enhance design, performance, usability and of cross-team implementation synchronization.
